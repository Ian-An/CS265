This program will convert a sequence number to the potential words or setences.
There has to be a stdin sequence of numbers, otherwise it will throw some errors.
The dictionary is based on an environment variable called ACMIA_WORDS, and its path will be passed into wordList function to get the data of the dictionary.
The compiling, running and cleaning files are all handled by ant. You would just type ant in command line to execute all these functions.
